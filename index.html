        <div class="subheading mb-5">Economics üìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! I'm Siddhant. I'm currently a first-year college student at the University of California, Riverside. I'm declaring my major in Economics and a minor in Computer Science. I've developed a multitude of skills during my first year. First, I've understood time management and making sure I balance schoolwork and extracurriculars. Next, I've been staying involved with two clubs, Mock Trial and ACM (Association of Computer Machinery), where I've been able to pursue my passion for law and computer science outside of my classes. In Mock Trial, we understand the legal process, going over attorney and witness roles. We prepare and then perform on one side, the prosecution or the defense, just like an actual trial. I really enjoy this club because I‚Äôm learning key information about the legal system, while also developing key skills like public speaking. Next, ACM has been an enriching club to be a part of, because I‚Äôve learned a lot. There are numerous opportunities present in the club, such as meetings where we discussed with one of UCR‚Äôs computer science professors the ethics of tech. Amazing meetings where we went over NFTs (non-fungible tokens) or practiced Leetcode challenges. In addition, planning is a huge skill that I've been recently learning and still developing. I've learned to provide myself with reminders and to stay committed to these events, due dates, and assignments.<br><br>

        Outside of school, I have some great hobbies and passions. First, I enjoy playing sports, primarily basketball and tennis. Also, I am a huge Lakers fan! Next, I do enjoy art whether it's tie-dying shirts, painting, or building a creation. For example, during last summer, based off of a YouTube video, I used grinded coffee beans to dye a t-shirt and some socks. It was definitely a fun experience. Furthermore, after learning from a YouTube video, I utilized the water from days of soaked black beans and avocado rinds to formulate an ‚Äúorganic‚Äù tie-dye shirt. Finally, I'm an avid music lover in almost all genres. Artists that  I enjoy listening to are the Beatles, Queen, Harry Styles, and Tyler, the Creator. Finally, I enjoy hiking and exploring nature parks. Some notable national parks I‚Äôve explored are Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Joshua Tree. My favorite national park would be Zion in Utah. In Zion, I love the blazing red orange colored dirt and the rock formations. <br><br>

        Some of my plans in the future are to develop a project in the field of cryptocurrencies, continue working on web development projects, and learn more about the legal system. The reason I want to delve into cryptocurrencies is not because of their financial capabilities but also the wide range of applications the blockchain brings where one‚Äôs imagination is the limit. Moving forward, the reason I want to pursue web development is that I‚Äôm really interested in websites, and how to build visually-appealing sites. I also enjoy the coding aspect, using the basic languages like HTML and CSS, but I‚Äôm also working on expanding to languages like React. Finally, I want to learn more about the legal system, because I want to pursue law school, and become a lawyer.
